# 4.Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Example 1:

nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
Example 2:

nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
分析：该题的目标是寻找两个有序排列数组合并后的中位数，中位数是指数组最中间的数字，如果数组长度为偶数，则是中间两个数字相加/2
